DBMS (database management system)
	- makes it convenient to access particular subset of data 
		* in relational databases, we use SQL (structural query language)
	- more efficient to grab rows when using a database
	- permanancy -- make sure the data survives
	- scalable (should be able to deal with massive amounts of data)
	- allows for multiple users
	
** DBMS sits on top of the OS which uses Disk
	- many are implemented with raw Disk IO
	- on top of the DBMS sits an API (ODBC / JDBC)
		* open database connection / java database connection
